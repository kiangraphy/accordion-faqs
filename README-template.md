What I have learned about this project is now I know how to build web project with accordion features which was dynamically to see. This could not be possible with embedding script(JS) file into it.


Although I have few knowledge of syntax in Javascript such as console.log to print the string, this however is a game changing and a headstart to embark the pure frontend, and sharpen my skills about it.



A few expectation in this project is I failed to comply due to learning gaps and other factor.



I expect to myself to reproduce more frontendmentor sample projects to have robust background in frontend and obtain confidence about applying to frontend job.


I also do not rush anything to have a job as soon as possible, I will take this frontend web dev learning journey according to my pace and sanity. I will manifest though (to land in the dream job) - which I attract, I do not chase, what's meant for me.. will find me.

I would like to thanks to who build frontendmnetor this learning opportunity helps individuals to become frontend web dev more convenient.
